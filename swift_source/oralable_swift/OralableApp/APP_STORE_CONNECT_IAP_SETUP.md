3. **Churn Rate**:
   - Target: <5% monthly churn
   - Monitor reasons for cancellations

4. **Revenue**:
   - Track MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
   - Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value) per subscriber

### Where to Monitor

- **App Store Connect** → **Sales and Trends**
- **App Analytics** → **Subscriptions**
- **Reports** → Download detailed CSV reports

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Product IDs don't match"
**Solution**: Product IDs in App Store Connect MUST exactly match the IDs in your code:
- Check `SubscriptionManager.swift` lines 28-35 (Patient App)
- Check `DentistSubscriptionManager.swift` (Dentist App)

### Problem: "Products not loading in app"
**Solution**:
1. Verify products are "Ready for Sale" status
2. Check app bundle ID matches exactly
3. Wait 24 hours after creating products (propagation delay)
4. Use sandbox account, not personal Apple ID

### Problem: "Sandbox purchase fails"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure StoreKit configuration is selected in scheme
2. Sandbox tester email must not be a real Apple ID
3. Sign out of real App Store account on device

### Problem: "Subscription doesn't renew"
**Solution**:
- Sandbox subscriptions renew fast (5 minutes = 1 month)
- Maximum 6 renewals in sandbox, then auto-cancels
- This is normal sandbox behavior

---

## Estimated Time

- Creating subscription groups: 30 minutes
- Adding all 6 products: 2 hours
- Localization and metadata: 1 hour
- Sandbox testing: 2 hours
- **Total: 5-6 hours**

---

## Pricing Strategy Recommendations

### Patient App

**Current Pricing**: €9.99/mo or €99.99/yr

**Considerations**:
- Health/wellness apps typically range €5-15/month
- Offering yearly discount (17% off) encourages annual commitment
- Free tier is essential for user acquisition

**Alternative Strategy**:
- Add mid-tier at €4.99/month (2 dentist shares, limited export)
- This can increase conversion from free users

### Dentist App

**Current Pricing**:
- Professional: €29.99/mo (50 patients)
- Practice: €99.99/mo (unlimited)

**Considerations**:
- B2B pricing - dentists can expense this
- €300/year is reasonable for practice management tool
- Consider offering 30-day free trial to convert dentists

**Alternative Strategy**:
- Add per-patient pricing: €1/patient/month (scales better)
- Offer practice-wide licenses for multi-provider offices

---

## Next Steps

After completing IAP setup:

1. Test thoroughly with sandbox accounts
2. Submit products for review (before app submission)
3. Complete app screenshots and metadata
4. Submit both apps for TestFlight Beta Review
5. Recruit beta testers (patients and dentists)
6. Monitor beta feedback
7. Submit for App Store Review
