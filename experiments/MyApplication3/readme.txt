Tim generated this app using gemini by getting it to look at the swift_source and just extract
the part that scans bluetooth and then displays the data from the device.
It worked for all readings except power on Tims Pixel 7 Pro.

I've not included the swift_source as its just a copy of oralable_swift and OralableCore
