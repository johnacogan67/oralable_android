## Smart Bruxism Monitoring

Understand your sleep. Protect your teeth.

Oralable is a wellness application that helps you monitor bruxism (teeth grinding) and track your sleep health. Connect your Oralable sensor device to see real-time heart rate, blood oxygen, and movement data. Share insights with your dentist for better care.

## How It Works

### Monitor

Wear your Oralable device while you sleep. The sensor tracks movement patterns, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels throughout the night.

### Detect

Our algorithms analyze your data to identify bruxism events and sleep patterns. Review your nightly summaries each morning.

### Share

Generate a secure share code to connect with your dentist. They can view your patterns over time and provide personalized recommendations.
